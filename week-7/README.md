- By completing this week we touched codechef difficulty rating of 1100. Now we are ready for the next step

- From week-8 we will start codeforces & we will provide 10 questions per week. If you want to stay with codechef then it's your personal choice. You can also do both. My recommendation is to solve codechef questions up to difficulty rating 1500 whenever you can manage your time. It's hard but it will help you a lot in future to be a dedicated problem solver.
